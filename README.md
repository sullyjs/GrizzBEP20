# GrizzBEP20
Solidity contract BEP20 for a basic charity token. 

Features:
- 2% fee auto add to the liquidity pool
- 2% fee auto distribute to all holders
- 4% fee auto moved to marketing & charity wallet

   500,000,000,000,000 total supply
   5,000,000,000,000 tokens limitation for trade, which is 1% of the total supply
   
   2% fee for liquidity will go to an address that the contract creates, 
   and the contract will sell it and add to liquidity automatically, 
   it's the best part of the #GRIZZ idea, increasing the liquidity pool automatically, 
   help the pool grow from the small init pool.
